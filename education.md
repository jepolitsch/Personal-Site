## Bioinformatics, La Sapienza 

* Expected graduation: June 2022
* Current GPA: 26/30
* Class Representative

[The course](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2020/30422/home) is taught completely in english and mainly deals with:

- Providing mathematical-statistical models which can be used in the analysis and interpretation of experimental biomolecular data. The most important aspect regards the need to integrate enormous quantities of data (big data) coming from extremely heterogeneous sources ("omics" technologies) to identify the "key" elements at the base of a specific biological process which is of interest to the medic/biologist.

- Developing computational models and methods for the analysis of biological sequences and gene expression data (genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenetic profiles, post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, genomic protein localization, genetic polymorphisms, RNA / DNA editing, etc.) in order to identify phylogenetic specificities/similarities and relevant mutations, which can be used, for example, in diagnosis and personalized medical therapies (tumors, vaccines, genetic diseases).

- Organizing integrated archives equipped with analysis platforms for a better use and presentation of biomolecular data

- Analyzing and predicting the structural and functional aspects of macromolecules and their interactions with ligands and drugs.

In this regard, a "new alliance" between bioengineering (bioinformatics), biology, chemistry and medicine appears to be of great strategic importance in order to respond to the challenges arising due to the overwhelming development of biomolecular technologies.
