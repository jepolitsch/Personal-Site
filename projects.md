# RNA-seq Analysis for Hylobius abietis -Whole Body tissue:

## Aims: Hylobius abietis is studied for its detramental effects on ecosystems in Europe. RNA-seq analysis allows the possibiliy to better understand the proteome of the pest, and open the door to possible control mechanisms.

In linux terniaml we run the following SRA toolkit package commands:
  ### Retreive the RNA-seq Data
  ./prefetch SRR6765939 
  ### Convert from SRA to Fastq
  ./fastq-dump SRR6765939.sra
